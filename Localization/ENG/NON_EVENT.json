    "But there was one problem: Luke was born with a bad leg and couldn't sit long in the saddle. So Luke set aside his dreams of adventure, to stand behind the counter at the grocery store, which he inherited from his late mother.",
    "There was a time when the name Logan Ford was on everyone's lips. Together with his partner Rufus Green, he hunted down dozens of robbers and <nobr>murderers —</nobr> even Rotten Sam, the most dangerous outlaw in the Wild West. But after the birth of his son Luke, Logan suddenly disappeared.",
    "\"Of course my father abandoned me. Why would a hero ever bother with some cripple?\" Luke thought. \"I'm just a pathetic little joke, I'll never be as great as him.\"",
    "But then, one day, Luke received a mysterious letter. \"Son, I don’t have long. By the time you read this, I'll already be dead. This map will lead you to a <nobr>thousand-</nobr><nobr>year-</nobr>old oak tree. I buried a chest filled with every bounty I collected in my life. Your father, Logan Ford.\"",
    "Luke's heart beat faster. Time to hit the road! \"But how do I get to the place on the map, if I can't even ride for five minutes?\" The boy was scared. He needed help!",
    "And who better to turn to than Rufus Green, Logan's former partner? \"You look just like your father when he was your age,\" croaked Rufus when Luke appeared at his door. \"I retired a long time ago, but I haven’t drunk away all my sense yet. Of course I'll help you!\"",
    "Rufus developed a miraculous training program, and within the week, Luke was a changed man. So confident in the saddle, he felt like he'd been on a horse his whole life.",
    "His father was already dead when Luke set off. His old enemy, Rotten Sam, had finally managed to track Logan down, and set an ambush with his gang of henchmen. Wounded in the gut, Logan hid in a small hotel on the outskirts of town. The day of his death, he drew a map, and dictated the letter for his son to the innkeeper.",
    "Rotten Sam tracked Logan to his final refuge, and tortured the innkeeper for the location of the <nobr>thousand-</nobr><nobr>year-</nobr>old oak.",
    "When Luke found the oak, Rotten Sam and his henchmen were already lifting Logan's chest from the hole. The air shook with the sound of gunshots. Luke fired so accurately, and held on so tight in the saddle, the bandits didn't stand a chance.",
    "Only Rotten Sam himself was able to escape. When the smoke cleared, Luke saw the outlaw galloping for the horizon, carrying the gold from the chest.",
    "Luke turned to the opened chest, and found a battered little book bound in leather. His father's diary!",
    "Luke read an entry written twenty years ago. “Rotten Sam has escaped from prison, and he'll surely seek revenge. My family is in danger. For their sake, I must disappear. I hope one day they can forgive me.\"",
    "Luke's tears fell onto the pages of the diary. “Father just wanted to protect me! He never thought of me as a <nobr>limp-</nobr>footed nobody!",

    "In a small town there lived a boy named Johnny Redman. He was <nobr>kind-</nobr>hearted, and a talented dancer. But he was also very shy. Whenever anyone watched him dance, Johnny became nervous and forgot all his moves.",
    "From an early age, Johnny always dreamt of winning the \"Crystal <nobr>Slipper\" —</nobr> the city main dance competition.",
    "For the past six years running, the Slipper had always gone to an arrogant slug named Duncan. Johnny applied for the competition, and danced in front of the selection committee. But one look from Duncan was enough to tangle our hero's legs and send him spinning to the floor. \"What are you doing, you idiot?\" the champion laughed. \"Not even a blind person could watch you dance!\"",
    "But Johnny never gave up. And the very next day, he came across a pamphlet for Chime, a dance club for the blind. Finally, the chance he needed to overcome fears, and get used to dancing in front of people. Then he could wipe the floor with Duncan!",
    "Johnny was determined to go to Chime that very evening, but his mother found the pamphlet in his bag. \"Don’t you dare think about dancing! Your stupid father loved dancing <nobr>too —</nobr> and danced himself all the way to prison!\" She scolded her son, and locked him in his room.",
    "But Johnny was flexible and limber. He squeezed through a tiny window, and went out for an evening of dancing.",
    "At \"Chime\" Johnny meets beautiful <nobr>Lily —</nobr> and a million butterflies flutter in his stomach! Lily wasn't blind either, and like Johnny was hoping to overcome <nobr>self-</nobr>doubt.",
    "Lily and Johnny danced and laughed all evening, and when they parted, they agreed to meet again.",
    "Every evening, Johnny escapes his room and meets Lily at the club. Their movements grow bolder and more exact. One day, Johnny wants to kiss Lily, but he can't. The boy's legs buckle with excitement, and he falls to the floor with a crash.",
    "That evening, Johnny shares his dream of winning the Crystal Slipper. Lily admits that she has the same <nobr>dream —</nobr> and since they're competitors, they can no longer be together.",
    "The whole next day, Johnny is tormented: \"Is dancing more important than true love?\" He finds Lily's address, and performs a clamorous dance right under her window. All the neighbors gather to gawk, but Johnny doesn't even care. He dances as passionately as ever.",
    "Amazed, Lily runs out into the street, and Johnny kisses <nobr>her —</nobr> and she kisses him back. \"Johnny, I don’t care about the competition! I want to be yours forever!\" Johnny and Lily decide they'll perform at the Crystal Slipper as a couple.",
    "The jury protest. \"This is a singles competition!\" But when Johnny sees Duncan among the competitors, he takes Lily by the hand and rushes onto the dance floor. At the end of a magical performance, Johnny kneels down and says two words to Lily. \"Marry me.\"",
    "The women choke and sob, the men give a standing ovation. The stunned jury goes against all the rules and awards Johnny and Lily the grand prize. Duncan is furious.",
    "Johnny and Lily realize they love each other more than anything. In the long summer evenings, they sit at the window holding hands, and talking about their feelings.",
    "A year after the wedding, Lily gives birth to a wonderful baby. Perhaps one day he too will become champion of the \"Crystal Slipper\"?",
    "One gloomy morning, seven Quentin Bounty prisoners stunned the guards, snuck into a warehouse, and escaped the prison hidden in a truck.",
    "Most of the fugitives were serving for theft and assault, but one of them was a true menace.",
    "That prisoner's name is Nick Crowe, but the papers all called him the Courier. He brought flowers to young women and then killed them. After five murders, the police captured the Courier on a lucky break, but they were never able to determine his motives. The maniac's first victim was his own fiancee, but the choice of the rest of the girls seemed random.",
    "The very next day after the escape, the Courier had already returned to his old ways. Dressed like a messenger, he delivered flowers to young Rita Peterson, then stabbed her to death. Bill Zeman, Rita's fiance, returned from work that evening, to find his beloved dead upon the floor, as his own desperate screams echoed through the neighborhood.",
    "Bill had little faith in the local police, so he hired a private investigator, Harry Burroughs. Harry was a young man, but he had sharp wits and a keen mind, enough to solve dozens of difficult cases, and even earn him the reputation of a genius.",
    "\"Rita and I had just got engaged,\" Bill Zeman offered helplessly as Harry examined the crime scene. The police had already taken away the body, but the bouquet of roses still remained on the living room <nobr>floor —</nobr> compliments of the Courier.",
    "Harry looked around the house and talked to the neighbors, but he couldn't catch a lead. He decided to contact Cathy Watts, a journalist who'd covered the Courier murders in detail. Cathy came right away, carrying a hefty file. She got right to the point.",
    "\"After the previous murders, I talked to Crowe's friends and learned about a cheap old shack he'd aquired long ago. It's past the city limits heading north. I told the police about the place when they arrested Crow two years ago, but they just brushed me off. They figured the case was already closed.",
    "Harry and Cathy hit the road, and soon enough they found the right house. It was a broken down hut, obviously unsuitable to live in. But our heroes then saw a man in front of the house, locking the door. As Harry's car approached, the stranger took off running towards the woods. Harry drew his gun and leapt from the car, but the man was already gone.",
    "\"We scared him off. Let's have a look inside.\" With that, Harry kicked the door down. The shack was practically empty. A carved wooden box drew Harry and Cathy's attention. Inside were six diamond rings. Trophies.",
    "\"Rita Peterson was recently engaged, and the courier was engaged to his first victim. What about the rest of the girls?\" Harry asked. Cathy flipped through the documents in her folder. \"Interesting! All the victims were soon getting married.\" Harry and Cathy trawled recent newspapers, looking for engagement announcements.",
    "Two couples surfaced: Rita and Bill, a tragedy already familiar to us, and also a certain Sandy Wick and her fiancé Tom. Harry and Cathy visited Sandy, who was happy to speak of yesterday's strange visitor. \"Yes, some messenger came with a bouquet of roses. No card, no note, just a bouquet. I decided it must be some kind of mistake, and I didn't take the flowers. The messenger just apologized and left.\"",
    "Harry immediately had a plan. He and Cathy hired a photographer, and posed as an engaged couple. They made sure to capture Harry's rented yellow brick house, the only one in the area. They advertised their engagement in the newspaper's morning edition, and paid an extra ten dollars to have the photo printed beside the article.",
    "At noon the next day there was a knock at the door. Cathy opened it, and there stood Nick Crow, the Courier, smiling nervously in the doorway with a bouquet of roses: \"This is from a secret admirer.\" Cathy feigned delight, took the bouquet and ran to put it in a vase, leaving the door wide open. The courier stepped into the house, pulled out his knife, raised <nobr>it —</nobr> and then felt a pistol at his temple. Harry's pistol.",
    "The Courier grew wild. \"You don't understand! Two years ago I was supposed to marry my dear Rachel, when suddenly she starts receiving anonymous bouquets. I became jealous, but she just laughed and accepted all the flowers, no matter how many or how secret they might be! One week later, and I caught her in some jerk's car! All these animals are the same. First they say it's only flowers, and then they break your heart! They deserve to be punished!\"",
    "The Courier won't be delivering any more flowers. This time, he was sentenced to the electric chair. Harry added another win to his list of cases, and Cathy wrote a book about the Courier. She called it \"Messenger of Death\".",

    "Son of the Fatherland",
    "In ancient Roman times there lived a great commander, Tankmar the Blond. He defended the empire from the hordes, and was famous for his ruthlessness. Tankmar had but one <nobr>weakness —</nobr> he loved children.",
    "Tankmar burned the huts of the barbarians and impaled their heads on spikes. But the orphaned children he fed and clothed, and on their knees they swore to renounce their ancestors and their animal ways. \"They were barbarian not by blood, but by upbringing. Plucked from the wild, they will become Romans.\" So said Tankmar.",
    "Once, a young barbarian named Ioske was on his knees before the Roman commander. Tankmar had torn his family limb from limb, but he'd spared Ioske. Yet the barbarian could not appreciate his kindness, and vowed revenge on Tankmar.",
    "The years passed. and Ioske grew. He became stronger, found his own tribe and became their chief. But the hatred in his barbarian heart was always seething.",
    "One day, Ioske turned to his fellow tribesmen. \"We will avenge our mothers and fathers!\" The barbarian horde shouted in reply. \"Let's take revenge! We'll gouge out Tankmar's eyes!\"",
    "No. Ioske said. \"That is not our goal. I have a dream. Tankmar's youngest son, Eberhard, will kneel before me and renounce his father. As once I renounced mine.\"",
    "That very night, the barbarians lay in wait for <nobr>blue-</nobr>eyed Eberhard, not far from the Roman camp. They captured and bound him, and brought him to Ioske. \"Kneel, and renounce your <nobr>father —</nobr> and I will spare you!\" Eberhard beheld his barbarian captors, and was so sickened by their twisted faces and ugly hooked noses that he nearly fainted in disgust.",
    "But Eberhard gathered his strength, stood his ground, and did not kneel. He proudly lifted his blond head, and spat right in the dirty barbarian's eye. Ioske wiped his face, and ordered Eberhard thrown into the deepest hole, until he came to his senses.",
    "When Tankmar learned that his youngest son was missing, he raised his fists to the moon. \"Sneaky Ioske! You never became a Roman! And you never will!\"",
    "He went to his wife and said quietly, \"I made a mistake, Verena. You were right all along. It is not by their upbringing that they are barbarians, but by their animal blood.\" Tankmar then took up the giant sword he inherited from his ancestors, and with all his might set the blade upon the grindstone, and in the morning he set forth.",
    "For three days, Tankmar followed Ioske's tracks, and at last he found the barbarian camp. He climbed up on the highest hill and shouted for all to hear. \"Listen to me, barbarians! A person can be educated, but an animal is always waiting for the moment to bite. Expect no further mercy! I shall put everyone in your tribe to the blade, young and old alike!\"",
    "With these words, Tankmar rushed to attack, and with a single stroke of his mighty sword he severed the heads of a dozen children. Then he set upon the adults. As the surviving barbarians fled in cowardice, Tankmar pulled his son from the pit. He took him in his arms, and they traveled home along the forest paths.",
    "The barbarians knew that Tankmar couldn't fight at full strength with Eberhard in his arms. They grew bold and hurried off in pursuit. The pursuers grew in number. Tankmar could hear the wild screams of the barbarians at his heels, the tramp of their feet, and the whistling arrows ready to pierce his neck.",
    "But Tankmar was stronger and more agile than they. He wove between the trees, skipping from path to path, gradually shaking off his pursuers. It was then, at the very edge of the forest, when Tankmar had nearly slipped his pursuers, that one of vile Ioske's arrows pierced his leg.",
    "Tankmar knew that he and his son would be taken prisoner, and forced to renounce their ancestors. He hugged Eberhard with all his strength. \"My son, it is better to die than to kneel before animals!\"",
    "His mighty hands gripped the hilt of his sword, and he impaled himself and his son upon the fearsome blade, through and through. With his final breath, the dying Tankmar whispered, \"Someday my glorious descendants will avenge... everything.\"",
    "The Sicilian Tiger",
    "Once upon a time in Sicily, there lived a boy named Alberto. He was the son of Colombino Conti, a <nobr>fourth-</nobr>generation <nobr>mafioso —</nobr> a king of thieves known throughout Italy.",
    "Alberto had no fondness for his life. Everything was given to him upon a silver platter, like he was a helpless woman. He knew he wanted to build his own happy life, for himself. He would step out of his father's shadow, and make his own dreams come true. He would go to America.",
    "One night, Alberto threw a bunch of grapes into his travel bag and ran away from his parents' house. He grabbed the oar he'd carved from an olive tree, and jumped into a gondola. Few would dare to take the voyage to America alone in such a modest craft, but Alberto was brave and full of purpose.",
    "After a week of sailing, he arrived in New York and got himself a job at the port. But he wouldn't be a Conti if he hadn't a sense of adventure.",
    "One day, Alberto saw five scoundrels with pistols robbing a guy on the street. Alberto stood up for him, and fought off the bandits with his bare hands! It so happened the poor fellow was no ordinary passerby, but the son of Dale Scrougio, the mafia boss who controlled half of New York.",
    "In gratitude, Scrougio took Alberto under his wing, and educated him in the local customs. Over time, they started trusting him with the most delicate of tasks. Alberto proved himself strong, courageous and <nobr>quick-</nobr>witted. Scrougio often said of Alberto, \"It’s a pity that my son isn't more like his friend.\"",
    "One day, at a city dance, Alberto met a girl named Sharisa. Alberto liked her smile and invited her out for dinner.",
    "It wasn't until their third date that Alberto learned that Sharisa was the daughter of none other than Benjamin Desmond, the head of the rival family, the one who controlled the other half of New York. But Alberto wasn't afraid of Sharisa's father. He would not meet her secretly like a schoolboy. He wanted everyone to see that he and Sharisa were in love.",
    "Desmond quickly learned of his daughter's adventures, and became furious. He struck Sharisa and growled through his teeth, \"You will marry my business partner Boncho Krugger. Or you will die.\" At the next mafia meeting, he delivered his competitor an ultimatum. \"Scrougio, hand over your pup Alberto, or you will regret it!\"",
    "But Scrougio would not betray Alberto. The boy had become even dearer to him than his own son. Instead, he hid the boy away in an abandoned house on the outskirts of the city. \"You must leave this place forever,\" he said, \"and never return.\" Alberto nodded gratefully and hugged Scrougio goodbye.",
    "Don't worry any more about Alberto, Scrougio said at his next meeting with Desmond. \"I've taken care of him.\" To this Desmond replied, \"I hope that means you killed him. You know what I do to people who disappoint me.\"",
    "But Alberto couldn't live without his beloved, and decided to take Sharisa with him. He made his way to the Desmond estate, and broke into the mansion. The guards were armed with blades, but his fists were all he needed. He freed his beloved, and later that same day, Alberto and Sharisa were on a train to Mexico.",
    "Desmond soon discovered that his daughter had run off with Alberto. \"Just as I thought,\" he hissed. \"Scrougio tricked me! You have only yourself to blame, old man!\" Late that night, Desmond and ten henchmen surrounded Dale Scrougio's house, and opened fire with <nobr>triple-</nobr>barreled guns.",
    "A hail of bullets turned the guards to mincemeat, killed the servants, and even Scrougio's son. But by some miracle, Scrougio himself survived. He managed to grab a gun, killed one bandit with a <nobr>well-</nobr>aimed shot, and barricaded himself in a bedroom. Desmond ordered the mansion burned. Scrougio choked and succumbed to the smoke as flames engulfed the building.",
    "When Alberto learned that Dale Scrougio had been killed, he clenched his fists so tightly that he left bloody marks on his palms. That evening, Alberto kissed Sharisa goodbye and returned to America to get revenge on Desmond.",
    "Back in New York, Alberto spoke to a gardener who saw what happened that night. He compiled a kill list, each of Desmond's henchmen involved in the raid.",
    "Alberto went from one mobster to the next, taking their lives. He stabbed Fat Sam in the eyes with his throwing knives, plunged a dagger into Skinny Tom's belly, shot Lanky Phil in the head with a pair of revolvers, and threw a garotte around Shorty Winnie's neck.",
    "Our hero became as death itself. Before the gangsters could reach for their guns, they were already dead on the floor. No one compared with Alberto, in precision, strength, or speed.",
    "Alberto made his way to the mafia leader's lair, where he found Desmond, and he'd taken a hostage... Sharisa! The poor girl secretly followed her beloved to New York. Her father put a revolver to his daughter's head. \"Surrender, Alberto. Or you alone will be to blame for her death!\"",
    "Alberto slowly raised his hands, but at the final moment pulled the trigger and fired at the chandelier above Desmond's head! The bullet, in an explosion of sparks, ricochets and hits Desmond right in the temple. Sharisa was saved!",
    "Finally, the surviving members of both clans came to Alberto with an offer. \"Signore Conti, you are the most worthy of men among us. Be our boss! Let us unite and become stronger than we have ever been before.\"",
    "After some thought, Alberto agreed. He united the clans, and made the New York family the most powerful syndicate in all of America. And Sharisa Desmond became his wife.",

And for the record the cement they made there was excellent, one of the ten best in the state!\nI don't know what this asshole hopes to find out, but he likes to pluck colorful facts out of the air.
