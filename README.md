A companion tool for the game that helps players find the best advertisers for their movie.

You can use the tool by visiting https://callon84.github.io/Hollywood-Animal-Calculator/

I recommend you do Ctrl + F5 to refresh the GitHub page. This is to ensure you get an up-to-date experience when the scripts have been updated/changed.

**Note:** For those wanting to use the script compatability function from the previous version of the tool, it's currently in gtting a re-work.
