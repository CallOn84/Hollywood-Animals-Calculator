This ia a web tool that helps players generate scripts, know the synergies of story elements, and find the best advertisers for their movie.

You can use the tool by visiting https://callon84.github.io/Hollywood-Animal-Calculator/

I recommend you do `Ctrl + F5` to refresh the GitHub page. This is to ensure you get an up-to-date experience when the scripts have been updated/changed.

Adapts aalbertinib's Hollywood Animal Master math logic for the Distribution Calculator.
